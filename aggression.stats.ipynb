    "In this notebook, we're going to simulate different agression levels against each other to determine roughly what optimal strategy in monopoly entails. While many parts of monopoly can be reduced to probability, and others are neccessary aspects of the game (such as buying as many properties as possible), the only remaining room for strategy comes through aggression in trades and buying houses/hotels.\n",

    "Under perfect play, trades are highly unlikely to occur. As monopoly is a zero-sum game, every trade adjusts the expected win rate of all parties involved. Thus, a trade is likely to only be completed if it only negatively effects a third party's expected win rate. A mock trading method is coded in our simulation to emulate basic trade logic.\n",
